/// `RSDStep` is the base protocol for the steps that can compose a task for presentation using a
/// controller appropriate to the device and application. Each `RSDStep` object represents one logical
/// piece of data entry, information, or activity in a larger task.
///
/// Implementations included in this SDK include:
/// 1. `RSDGenericStep` is used by `RSDFactory` to create a step that does not include a recognized
///     subtype.
/// 2. `RSDSectionStep` is used to define a logical subgroup of steps.
/// 3. `RSDUIStep` is used to define a display step.
/// 4. `RSDTaskInfoStep` is used to combine tasks into a single flow. For example, if the researcher wishes
///     to ask for survey responses before an activity.
///
/// A step can be a question, an active test, or a simple instruction. An `RSDStep` subclass is usually
/// paired with an `RSDStepController` that controls the actions of the step.
