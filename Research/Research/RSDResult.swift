/// `RSDResult` is the base implementation for a result associated with a task, step, or asynchronous action.
///
/// When running a task, there will be a result of some variety used to mark each step in the task. This is
/// the base protocol. All the `RSDResult` objects are required to conform to the `Encodable` protocol to allow
/// the app to store and upload results in a standardized way.
///
/// - note: The `RSDResult` protocol requires conformance to the `Encodable` protocol but does *not* require
/// conformance to `Decodable`. This allows using class objects that cannot be extended to conform to the
/// `Decodable` protocol, such as `ORKResult` classes.
