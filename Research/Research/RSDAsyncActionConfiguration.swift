/// `RSDAsyncActionConfiguration` defines general configuration for an asynchronous background action that
/// should be run in the background. Depending upon the parameters and how the action is set up, this could
/// be something that is run continuously or else is paused or reset based on a timeout interval.
///
/// The configuration is intended to be a serializable object and does not call services, record data, or
/// anything else. It does include a step identifier that can be used to let the `RSDTaskController` know when
/// to trigger the async action.
///
/// - seealso: `RSDTaskController` and `RSDAsyncAction`.
