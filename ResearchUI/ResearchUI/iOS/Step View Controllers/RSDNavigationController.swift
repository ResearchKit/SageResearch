/// features of a navigation controller, while passing control of the step to the step controller.
///
/// - note: For applications that customize the navigation controller with their own subclass implementation,
///         this implementation can be copy/pasted and used to extend that custom implementation. This
///         framework does *not* force using this implementation by extending `UINavigationController`
